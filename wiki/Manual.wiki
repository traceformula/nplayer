Brief overview of how to use the application


= Details =

There are four main areas in the application: Characters, Groups, Forges and Battles. In Characters you can create all your character, using the items, classes, races, feats, powers and everything else created in the Forges. It is a good idea to restart your system after you have either created or modified something in the Forges. You can then assign your Characters to Groups that you create, which furthermore can be selected to Battle against each other in the Battle screen.
