# Introduction #

Forges are there for you to create and expand the universe in which you play. Using the various forges you can create items such as weapons, armours, rings, etc., races, classes, actions, feats and powers. The three later ones are and will be in development for a long time as the way these can be used are intricate and difficult to cater for. You need to be aware of this as you might have to recreate them.
